# Data Processing and Clustering Project

This project demonstrates the process of standardizing a dataset, reducing its dimensionality, and applying clustering algorithms to uncover patterns. The key steps involved include the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and K-means for clustering.

## Project Overview

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**: The project utilizes various libraries including `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.

2. **Separating Features and Labels**: The dataset is split into features (`X`) and labels (`y`).

3. **Standardizing the Data**: The feature data is standardized to ensure consistency in the analysis.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction Using PCA**: PCA is applied to reduce the data to 2 dimensions for easier visualization.

5. **Determining Optimal Number of Clusters**: The elbow method is employed to identify the optimal number of clusters by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).

6. **Applying K-means Clustering**: K-means clustering is applied to the PCA-transformed data, and cluster assignments are predicted.

7. **Visualizing the Clusters**: The clusters are visualized by plotting the PCA-reduced data and marking the cluster centers.

## Dependencies

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`


## Running the Code

1. Ensure all necessary libraries are installed.
2. Load the dataset and split it into features (`X`) and labels (`y`).
3. Standardize the feature data using `StandardScaler`.
4. Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.
5. Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
6. Apply K-means clustering to the PCA-transformed data.
7. Visualize the resulting clusters.

## Future Work

- Explore additional clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering).
- Experiment with other dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP, LDA, Isomap).
- Improve visualization by adding interactive plots.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive workflow for processing, reducing dimensionality, and clustering a dataset, offering insights into the underlying structure of the data.
